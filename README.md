# PHY581C: Microelectronics Experimental ASIC Design

The goal of this project is to design an ASIC for single-photon photodetector readout (known as SiPM or Silicon Photo-electron Multiplier). The circuit must perform high speed, low noise amplification and discrimination to allow pico-second timing measurement. The circuit was designed using **Cadence Virtuoso** and a library of TSMC components was used for layout.
